# okLCh Ramp Studio

A single-file, zero-dependency browser tool for generating perceptually uniform UI color ramps using the **okLCh colorspace**, with hex output and multiple export formats.

---

## Overview

Traditional color ramps built in HSL or HSB are perceptually uneven — steps that look visually equal in the color picker may appear dramatically different in weight on screen. okLCh solves this by working in a colorspace modeled on human vision, where equal numeric steps produce equal perceived differences.

okLCh Ramp Studio generates ramps where every stop is defined by:

- **L** — lightness (0 = black, 1 = white), perceptually uniform
- **C** — chroma (colorfulness), automatically shaped by a curve
- **h** — hue angle (0–360°)

All output is converted to sRGB hex for direct use in CSS, design tools, or config files.

---

## Usage

Open `oklch-ramp-studio.html` in any modern browser. No build step, no server, no dependencies. Works on desktop and mobile.

Click any swatch or hex chip to copy that value to the clipboard. Use the Export buttons to generate structured output.

## Interface

### Light / Dark Mode

A **DARK / LIGHT** toggle in the header switches the entire page chrome — all backgrounds, borders, text, and UI surfaces — between a near-black dark theme and an off-white light theme via CSS custom property overrides. This lets you evaluate ramp swatches against the same kind of surface they'll actually appear on in your product.

### Ramp Display

The hero swatch row and hex strip at the top render **dark to light, left to right** — matching the X axis of the curve canvas below, where L = 0 (black) is on the left and L = 1 (white) is on the right. Click or tap any swatch to copy its hex value to the clipboard.

## Controls

### Hue & Chroma

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hue** | Base hue angle in degrees (0–360). The slider track renders a live perceptual hue gradient. |
| **Saturation** | A multiplier applied to the entire chroma curve. 1.0 = curve as-is; values below 1 produce more neutral/muted ramps; values above 1 push toward maximum chroma. |
| **Chroma Peak** | The maximum chroma value reached at the apex of the curve. Higher values produce more vivid mid-tones. |
| **Peak at L** | The lightness value at which chroma peaks. 0.55 biases the most vivid color slightly above mid-gray, which tends to feel natural. Shift toward 0.3–0.4 for ramps that pop in dark UI; toward 0.6–0.7 for light UI. |
| **L-Knee L** | Lightness position of the left knee — the intermediate control point between the dark anchor and the peak. Moving it closer to the dark end steepens the initial rise; moving it closer to the peak produces a more gradual ramp up. |
| **L-Knee C** | Chroma at the left knee. Higher values pull the curve upward on the dark side, creating a fuller shoulder; lower values keep it lean near the dark anchor. |
| **R-Knee L** | Lightness position of the right knee — the intermediate control point between the peak and the light anchor. Moving it closer to the peak steepens the descent; moving it toward the light end produces a long, gradual tail. |
| **R-Knee C** | Chroma at the right knee. Controls the fullness of the curve's light-side shoulder, mirroring the role of L-Knee C on the dark side. |

The **curve canvas** below these controls visualizes the 5-point chroma-vs-lightness shape, dark on the left and light on the right. The five control points — **Dark**, **L-Knee**, **Peak**, **R-Knee**, and **Light** — are drawn as labelled circles. Each ramp step is plotted as a colored diamond.

### Lightness Range & Steps

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Light end** | Lightness of the lightest stop (step 50). Default 0.97 ≈ near-white. |
| **Dark end** | Lightness of the darkest stop (step 950). Default 0.12 ≈ very dark. |
| **Steps** | Number of stops in the ramp. Odd values only (3–21). Stop keys are distributed evenly across a 50–950 scale (e.g. 11 steps → 50, 140, 230 … 950). |
| **Hue shift** | Applies a linear hue rotation from the lightest to darkest stop. +20° on a blue ramp, for example, will push darks slightly toward purple and lights toward cyan — mimicking the natural appearance of pigment. Set to 0 for a clean, hue-stable ramp. |

### L Spacing

Controls how lightness values are distributed across the ramp. All three modes anchor the lightest and darkest stops at the same L values — only the placement of the intermediate stops changes.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **LINEAR** | Equal spacing between every L value. Simple and predictable; a good default when you want evenly distributed stops. |
| **PARABOLIC** | Steps concentrate near the lightest and darkest extremes, with wider gaps in the midtones. Implemented as a cosine ease-in/out curve (`0.5 − 0.5·cos(π·t)`). Because chroma peaks in the midtones, this places fewer stops where chroma variation is highest and more stops near the neutral extremes — useful when you need fine-grained light and dark shades for surfaces and text while accepting coarser midtone resolution. |
| **ADJUSTED** | Applies a gamma-like correction (`t^0.77`) derived from the Munsell value scale, which models perceived equal lightness steps in human vision. The result compresses the dark end slightly relative to the light end, producing stops that feel more equidistant when viewed. Recommended when perceptual uniformity matters most — for example, accessible neutral ramps or UI grays where banding is noticeable. |

The curve canvas updates in real time to show dot positions for the active spacing mode.

### Gamut Handling

okLCh can describe colors that lie outside the sRGB triangle. The gamut toggle offers three modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **SMART** | Binary-searches for the highest chroma value at the same L and h that still fits in sRGB. Hue and lightness are fully preserved. Recommended for design systems requiring clean, predictable output. |
| **NAIVE** | Clips RGB channels directly after conversion. Fast and simple, but out-of-gamut colors will shift in both hue and lightness. Useful for seeing how much of a ramp is theoretically outside sRGB. |
| **COMP** | Chroma-space ratio compression. For each step, the maximum in-gamut chroma at that exact L and h is found via binary search. If the requested chroma exceeds this ceiling, the excess is retained but attenuated by the compression ratio rather than hard-cut. Because hue is never touched, the result preserves more of the original saturation intent while introducing only a small lightness drift — and because the gamut ceiling varies by hue angle, the effect is uneven across the ramp, producing character that changes as you move the Hue slider. |

**Ratio** (COMP mode only, 1.5:1 to 20:1): Controls how aggressively excess chroma is attenuated. Low ratios like 2:1 retain most of the excess — more character, more drift. High ratios like 16:1 approach hard-clip behavior, converging toward NAIVE. The 3:1–6:1 range tends to be most useful.

Each step shows a **✓** (in gamut) or **⚠** (compressed/clipped) chip below the controls.

### Color System View

Disabled by default. When toggled **ON**, reveals a two-part interface for visualizing your primary ramp alongside up to 11 additional hues — all sharing the same curve settings.

**Controls:**

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **ON / OFF toggle** | Enables the system view panel and the visualization matrix below the controls. |
| **Additional hues** | Slider (1–11) setting how many companion ramps to display. Increasing the count auto-fills new slots with hues distributed evenly around the wheel relative to the primary hue (at offsets of 120°, 240°, 60°, 180°, etc.). Decreasing it removes slots from the end without disturbing existing entries. |
| **Hue cards** | One card per additional hue. Each card contains a midtone color dot preview (updates live), an optional text label, a degree input (0–360), and a mini hue-wheel slider. The number input and slider stay in sync. |

**Visualization matrix:**

A full-width ramp grid rendered below the controls. Each row represents one ramp — the primary (marked with an accent border) appears first, followed by additional hues in card order. All rows share the same lightness range, step count, chroma curve, hue shift, and gamut mode as the primary, so every ramp is directly comparable on those axes; only the base hue differs.

Column headers show step keys. Hover any swatch cell to see its hex value in a tooltip; click to copy it to the clipboard.

## Step Key Convention

Steps follow the Tailwind / Radix convention:

```
50 · 140 · 230 · 320 · 410 · 500 · 590 · 680 · 770 · 860 · 950
```

For an 11-step ramp. The lightest stop is always `50` and the darkest is always `950`, with intermediate keys distributed linearly. Fewer or more steps compress or expand the key distribution accordingly.

## The Chroma Curve

Rather than requiring manual chroma entry per stop, the studio uses a **5-point monotone cubic spline** to describe the chroma-vs-lightness shape. The curve is anchored to zero chroma at both ends of the ramp and passes exactly through five control points:

```
(darkEnd_L, 0)   →   (lKneeL, lKneeC)   →   (peakL, peakC)   →   (rKneeL, rKneeC)   →   (lightEnd_L, 0)
```

This directly models design intent: you choose where chroma rises, where it peaks, and how it falls — rather than dialing abstract EQ parameters.

### Interpolation

The curve is computed using the **Fritsch-Carlson monotone cubic Hermite spline** algorithm. Monotone interpolation guarantees the spline never overshoots between two adjacent control points, which means chroma cannot go negative or exceed the peak — even when the knee points are set asymmetrically.

### Control points

| Point | Controls |
|---|---|
| **Dark anchor** | Fixed at `(darkEnd_L, 0)` — always zero chroma at the darkest stop. |
| **L-Knee** | `(L-Knee L, L-Knee C)` — shapes how quickly chroma rises from the dark anchor toward the peak. A low L position steepens the initial rise; a high C value broadens the dark shoulder. |
| **Peak** | `(Peak at L, Chroma Peak)` — the chroma apex, scaled by Saturation. |
| **R-Knee** | `(R-Knee L, R-Knee C)` — shapes the descent from peak toward the light anchor. Mirrors the role of the left knee on the light side. |
| **Light anchor** | Fixed at `(lightEnd_L, 0)` — always zero chroma at the lightest stop. |

The ordering constraint `darkEnd < L-Knee L < Peak at L < R-Knee L < lightEnd` is enforced at render time, so the curve always has a valid shape regardless of slider positions.

## Browser Compatibility

Requires a browser with support for:
- `oklch()` CSS color function (for the hue slider track gradient) — Chrome 111+, Firefox 113+, Safari 15.4+
- Canvas 2D API
- Clipboard API (for copy-on-click; degrades silently if blocked)

All color math is implemented natively in JavaScript; no CSS `oklch()` is used for the actual swatch rendering, so the hex output is universally compatible.
